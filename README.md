This is the repository for our group assignment of machine learning course. The task is to finish hotel room price prediction on Kaggle competition. The goal of this assignment is to benchmark different Machine Learning regression models that predict average daily hotel room rates based on a range of indicators. 

What we do:
Data preprocessing
Create the linear baseline 
Build three non-linear models

Except the R code, we also have the technical report that write in LATEX.

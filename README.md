# ml22-team12

This is the repository for our group assignment of machine learning course. The task is to finish hotel room price prediction on Kaggle competition. The goal of this assignment is to benchmark different Machine Learning regression models that predict average daily hotel room rates based on a range of indicators. 

# Structure 

we stored our data in the data folder as structure below: 

- results:
results of diffirent models 

- Gold:
dataset after cleaning and feature engineering 

- Silver:
dataet after cleaning 

- Bronze:
original dataset 
 
# What we do:

1.Data preprocessing

2.Create the linear baseline 

3.Build other models

Except the R code, we also have the technical report.
